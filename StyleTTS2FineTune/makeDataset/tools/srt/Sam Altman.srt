1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,219
Okay, today I'm going to talk about how to succeed with a startup.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,128
Obviously more than can be said here in 20 minutes, but I will do the best I can.

3
00:00:09,148 --> 00:00:22,714
The most important thing, the number one lesson we try to teach startups is that the degree to which you're successful approximates the degree to which you build a product that is so good people spontaneously tell their friends about it.

4
00:00:22,694 --> 00:00:25,177
Startups always ask us for the secret to success.

5
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:28,960
They always want to believe it's something other than this, because this is really hard to do.

6
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:31,063
But this is it.

7
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:38,731
If you can build a product that is so good, people spontaneously tell their friends about it, you have done 80% of the work that you need to be a really successful startup.

8
00:00:39,632 --> 00:00:49,001
If you think about the most successful companies you know, Google, Facebook, whatever, you probably found out about them because a friend of yours said, you got to try this, it's great.

9
00:00:49,021 --> 00:00:50,743
So this is the bar.

10
00:00:50,723 --> 00:00:52,967
Something that people love so much they tell their friends about it.

11
00:00:54,470 --> 00:01:01,021
One important indicator for a product like that is a product that's simple to explain and easy to understand.

12
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:07,974
If you can't explain in a few words what you do, and if people don't, if at least some people don't say, oh, that's pretty interesting, that's usually a mistake.

13
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:12,141
It's usually a sign of unclear thinking or a need that is not big enough.

14
00:01:14,062 --> 00:01:22,011
Another thing that startups need to look for is a market that is either started to undergo or is soon going to undergo exponential growth.

15
00:01:22,031 --> 00:01:26,316
I think this is actually related to one of the biggest mistakes investors make when evaluating startups.

16
00:01:27,157 --> 00:01:28,879
Investors always say, well, what's your growth rate?

17
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:29,880
We care about the growth rate.

18
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:33,625
Investors will forgive smallish revenue today if it's growing quickly.

19
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:37,369
For some reason, people don't think about markets this way.

20
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:45,239
But if you think about the most important startups, they are the ones that start in small markets that are growing very, very quickly.

21
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,422
11 years ago, the market for iPhone apps was $0.

22
00:01:47,822 --> 00:01:49,344
It's now huge.

23
00:01:49,645 --> 00:01:53,109
And I think if you only think about the TAM today, you'll make a big mistake.

24
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:59,357
What you really want to do is identify a market that's going to grow every year and be able to ride that up elevator.

25
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:07,996
A really important thing to figuring this out is learning how to differentiate between real trends and fake trends.

26
00:02:08,397 --> 00:02:12,767
A real trend is something that's actually going to happen and a fake trend is not, or at least not yet.

27
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:17,478
And before you make a big bet on a new platform, you want to make sure it's real.

28
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:19,843
Now, there's an easy trick for this, which I'll share now.

29
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:27,976
Real trends are ones where a new technology platform comes along and the early adopters use it obsessively and tell their friends how much they love it.

30
00:02:28,577 --> 00:02:34,266
A fake trend is one where people may buy the product but don't use it or at least not enough.

31
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:39,013
So an example of a real trend, I already mentioned the iPhone, I'll mention that again.

32
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:43,705
When the iPhone first came out, many people were dismissive because they only sold a million or two million that year.

33
00:02:44,387 --> 00:02:45,831
And they said, well, this just doesn't matter.

34
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:49,460
But for the people that had an iPhone, they used it for hours every day.

35
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,944
It became central to their lives.

36
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:51,505
They loved it.

37
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:52,969
They told their friends, you've got to get one.

38
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:58,028
And I think it was obvious then to people paying attention that something had fundamentally shifted.

39
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:03,401
And we had a new computing platform that was going to spawn huge businesses.

40
00:03:03,421 --> 00:03:05,326
And it was a good time to bet on mobile apps.

41
00:03:06,488 --> 00:03:10,418
A fake trend, or at least a fake trend as of August 2018,

42
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,721
I would say is VR.

43
00:03:12,222 --> 00:03:19,197
I do believe VR will be big someday, but today most people that I know that own a VR headset use it never or very rarely.

44
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:29,841
And so although a lot of people talk about it and maybe even a lot of people buy them, there's not the intense usage per user among the early adopters that I think you want to see before you make a big bet.

45
00:03:32,285 --> 00:03:36,312
Another thing that startups need, at least one evangelical founder, usually the CEO.

46
00:03:37,153 --> 00:03:45,507
Someone at the startup has got to be the person that is going to recruit, sell the product, talk to the press, raise money.

47
00:03:45,827 --> 00:03:53,500
And this requires someone who can infect with enthusiasm the whole world about what the company is trying to do.

48
00:03:53,682 --> 00:04:01,865
And someone who becomes the chief evangelist for the company, it's very hard to succeed wildly without that.

49
00:04:01,905 --> 00:04:04,452
It's very hard to build a team at all without being able to do that.

50
00:04:05,309 --> 00:04:09,194
One thing that helps for this is having an ambitious vision.

51
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,257
You never want to be grandiose.

52
00:04:11,277 --> 00:04:12,619
That turns people off.

53
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,163
But you want to let yourself grow more ambitious over time.

54
00:04:15,603 --> 00:04:18,207
And as long as you do that organically, people will respond.

55
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:20,450
Ambitious visions are exciting.

56
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:21,752
They're fun to work on.

57
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:29,142
In fact, I think in 2018, at least in Silicon Valley, it's easier to start a hard startup than it is to start an easy startup.

58
00:04:29,863 --> 00:04:34,590
Now, this sounds paradoxical, but ambitious projects are interesting.

59
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,379
You know, in the current environment, it may be relatively easy to raise capital, but it's really hard to do everything else.

60
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,561
There's so many startups.

61
00:04:41,122 --> 00:04:42,064
It's so easy to start one.

62
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:50,279
They all sound so promising that bringing together enough talent in one organization is really hard to do.

63
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:56,650
And if you're working on a problem that, you know, may be modestly successful, it's kind of easy to get the first few people to join.

64
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:58,654
You can give them a lot of equity.

65
00:04:58,634 --> 00:04:59,718
But then it gets really hard.

66
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,585
Why is employee 20 going to join?

67
00:05:01,645 --> 00:05:03,854
Why does this matter to the world?

68
00:05:03,894 --> 00:05:07,969
Why should someone work on your startup versus any of the other things they could do?

69
00:05:09,417 --> 00:05:12,481
And picking something that matters if you're successful is a great way to do that.

70
00:05:13,242 --> 00:05:24,776
And so I think it's really important to think about when you're starting a company, how is this going to evolve into a vision that a lot of people want to help with, that a lot of people want to be associated with?

71
00:05:25,257 --> 00:05:30,824
Because I think getting talent and getting mindshare is really hard in the current environment.

72
00:05:30,844 --> 00:05:33,147
And people are interested in startups that matter.

73
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:39,458
Another thing that we've noticed among our best founders again and again and again.

74
00:05:40,653 --> 00:05:44,236
is that they have a confident and definite view of the future.

75
00:05:44,897 --> 00:06:09,478
They may be wrong, and so we say it's good to be confident and flexible, but this idea that you are confident and definite, this is what I think is going to happen, or this is what is going to happen, and being relatively sure of that, having courage of your convictions, being a clear leader, saying we're gonna do this, and that's why, even in the face of a lot of doubt, that seems to really correlate with success.

76
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:22,689
And this comes back to having an ambitious vision, but the entire startup ecosystem is best set up to support companies that have a low chance of success but are huge if they work.

77
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:28,362
And I think going for something that is huge if it works will attract the best people.

78
00:06:30,788 --> 00:06:32,870
I'm not going to talk too much about the team.

79
00:06:33,371 --> 00:06:42,020
There are a lot of obvious things I could say that have been said many times by many people about, you know, you need smart people who want to work really hard and who communicate well.

80
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:51,430
These are all really true, but I'd like to mention a few non-obvious things that we've noticed that we don't hear people say as much about the team you need to assemble.

81
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,475
Vinod Khosla says that the team you build is the company you build, and I really think that's true.

82
00:06:56,455 --> 00:07:03,287
I've still met only a handful of founders, I think, that spend enough time on recruiting, like Mark Zuckerberg is famously one of them.

83
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:10,360
But building a great team, I think, other than picking the right market and building a great product is the most important thing you do.

84
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:19,797
All founders go through a transition, all successful founders, where you switch from building a product to building a company, and building a company really is about the team.

85
00:07:19,777 --> 00:07:23,302
So you need optimists.

86
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:27,667
The whole world will be telling you why you're going to fail as a startup.

87
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:40,204
If you don't have that internal fire of belief, if you don't have people who say, you know what, we are going to do this, and it doesn't matter what the haters say, we're going to figure this out, and there is, you know, this problem, it must be solvable.

88
00:07:40,224 --> 00:07:47,353
If you don't have the spirit of optimism on the team, it's very hard to succeed when the world continues to punch you in the face.

89
00:07:48,295 --> 00:07:50,719
You need at least some idea generators.

90
00:07:50,739 --> 00:08:00,914
There are a handful of people in any company that has gone on to be really successful that I that I've been able to work with, who are just really good at coming up with lots of ideas.

91
00:08:01,194 --> 00:08:05,160
You don't too many of these people because that's more ideas than a company can follow through on.

92
00:08:05,921 --> 00:08:15,636
But having some people within a company that are just constantly throwing out new ideas, most of which will be bad, turns out to be super important to have on the team.

93
00:08:16,595 --> 00:08:24,810
The spirit of we'll figure it out is my favorite thing to hear among early startup team members.

94
00:08:25,351 --> 00:08:27,194
A lot of things go wrong.

95
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:30,399
The situations that startups win in tend to be incredibly dynamic.

96
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:40,898
And so this idea that even if I'm not qualified on paper, even if I haven't solved this problem before, even if this problem feels like it's going to kill the company, which many problems will feel that way.

97
00:08:40,878 --> 00:08:45,466
This spirit among the team of, you know what, we've got the people we need.

98
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,607
We're going to figure this out.

99
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:47,529
We're going to get this done.

100
00:08:48,871 --> 00:08:51,896
That's super important.

101
00:08:51,916 --> 00:08:54,821
Another thing that I love to hear from early team members is, I've got it.

102
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:59,188
So, you know, you hear in big companies a lot of people say, that's not my department.

103
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,430
Someone else is going to do that.

104
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:02,514
Or, you know, ooh, this is really bad.

105
00:09:02,534 --> 00:09:04,016
This is going to hurt us.

106
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:05,979
And you want people who just step up and say, I'll do it.

107
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:06,660
I've got it.

108
00:09:07,001 --> 00:09:07,662
Don't worry about it.

109
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,683
You want people to have a bias towards action.

110
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:17,509
Startups, especially in their early days, often win by moving very quickly.

111
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,032
You never get as much data as you'd like.

112
00:09:20,052 --> 00:09:21,994
You never have as much time to deliberate as you'd like.

113
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:30,083
And you want people who are willing to act with much less data than they'd like to have, with much less certainty.

114
00:09:30,624 --> 00:09:34,088
And then if they act and it doesn't work, they adapt really quickly and try something else.

115
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,193
We talk also about the blessing of inexperience.

116
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:46,741
We have seen many of our startups do incredible things because no one told them it was hard, or no one told them they can't do it.

117
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:53,368
There's a great quote from Steve Wozniak about how all the best things he ever did came from having no experience whatsoever and having no money.

118
00:09:54,309 --> 00:10:05,121
And, you know, that obviously is not always true, but there is a magic thing that happens with startups, especially in their early days, before they've learned they're not supposed to be able to do certain things.

119
00:10:05,101 --> 00:10:14,976
And so I think as a startup, again, it doesn't work to have everybody be inexperienced, but you can take more bets than you normally would on inexperienced but super high potential people.

120
00:10:16,424 --> 00:10:18,788
That's the end of the topic on team.

121
00:10:20,492 --> 00:10:24,279
One of the most important jobs you have as a founder is to never lose momentum.

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,032
And this is a little bit depressing because it means for the first few years you never get to take your foot off the gas, you never get to really rest.

123
00:10:32,154 --> 00:10:36,542
We try to be honest about this, that startups are not the best choice for work-life balance.

124
00:10:36,522 --> 00:10:39,145
at all, but especially in the early days.

125
00:10:39,165 --> 00:10:41,628
Startups survive on their own momentum.

126
00:10:41,989 --> 00:10:47,135
If you have momentum, people keep delivering results beyond what they think they're capable of.

127
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:49,538
If you lose momentum, it's very difficult to get it back.

128
00:10:50,459 --> 00:11:04,015
And so, continuing to make sure that the startup has a cadence, that the startup keeps winning on a relatively short and predictable intervals, this is really important, and it's up to the founders to make sure that you don't lose a hold of this.

129
00:11:06,577 --> 00:11:11,805
Another thing that we think startups need is a competitive advantage over time.

130
00:11:12,186 --> 00:11:15,791
Now, this is something that sounds so obvious, I hesitated to even put it in.

131
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:26,308
This is well-discussed, but we're seeing more and more startups apply to YC, and when we ask them, so what is the long-term monopoly effect here?

132
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:28,391
What is the long-term competitive advantage?

133
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:30,635
Where is the network effect in this business?

134
00:11:31,195 --> 00:11:34,761
They look at us like it's the first time they've ever heard this question.

135
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:39,428
Um, all of the really great businesses I know, um, have an answer to this question.

136
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:42,172
And in fact, the better they are, the more they pretend not to.

137
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:47,019
Um, but this is something that you, you want to have a plan for.

138
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,263
Another thing you want to have a plan for is at least a sensible business model.

139
00:11:51,365 --> 00:11:52,887
You don't have to have it all figured out at the beginning.

140
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:56,973
Um, but when we ask founders, so how are you ever going to make money?

141
00:11:56,993 --> 00:12:02,281
And they look at us like it's the first time they've ever been asked that question, which happens more often than you would think recently.

142
00:12:02,301 --> 00:12:03,162
That's a bad sign too.

143
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:08,020
Again, this one is so common that I hesitate to put it in here.

144
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:16,375
But when we ask a startup how they're going to grow, how they're going to get users, and they look at us like it's the first time they've ever heard that question, bad sign.

145
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:19,260
So some sensible idea to try here first.

146
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:32,313
Paul Buchheit once spent a bunch of time looking, one of the YC partners, spent a bunch of time looking at the traits of our best founders and tried to distill down what they were.

147
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:35,559
And he came up with frugality, focus, obsession, and love.

148
00:12:36,842 --> 00:12:38,565
I actually, I think that is really good.

149
00:12:38,585 --> 00:12:39,427
I don't have much to add.

150
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:45,518
But I think these are things that you should be able to say about what you're doing and you as a founder.

151
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:50,895
And finally, I want to talk about why startups get to beat big companies.

152
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:53,979
There are lots of reasons.

153
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:55,622
I'm going to talk about a few common ones here.

154
00:12:56,182 --> 00:13:05,035
I think these trends are valuable enough that as you evaluate startup ideas you might do, it's worth thinking about if you fit into these.

155
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,400
Because it's really hard for startups to beat big companies most of the time.

156
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:12,366
And here are some areas where we see it happening repeatedly.

157
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:30,586
So I think one difference is if you are a product manager at a big company and you want to do something that sounds like a bad idea but is a good idea, you have to get everybody from your boss, sometimes all the way up to the CEO, to say yes.

158
00:13:30,606 --> 00:13:32,828
So one no can kill you.

159
00:13:32,848 --> 00:13:39,855
If you're a startup, you can go to YC Demo Day, any number of the thousands of investors can say yes and you get to have a crack at it.

160
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:49,865
So it's a very different mindset and for those ideas that sound bad but are good, because of this phenomenon, this one no versus one yes, startups can win.

161
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,531
In fact, startups usually do beat big companies in that category of ideas.

162
00:13:55,273 --> 00:14:05,269
So look for ideas that sound bad but are good and where you are much more likely to get one yes than someone at a big company is to get all yeses.

163
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:12,716
Another area where startups usually beat big companies are in very fast-changing markets.

164
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:16,159
Startups' great advantage is in agility and speed.

165
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:25,508
The more a market is changing, the higher the number of decisions you get to make and the higher number of tweaks to your product and your strategy you get to make.

166
00:14:25,968 --> 00:14:35,577
And you want to optimize the number of those decisions that someone has to make to compete with you because a big company will make them, on average, worse and certainly much slower than you do.

167
00:14:35,557 --> 00:14:42,647
So, the speed of market evolution gives you a lot more chances to compound your advantage over a big company.

168
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:49,313
And then finally, startups usually win on big platform shifts.

169
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:53,199
Many people have observed that startups come in these clusters.

170
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,344
Those clusters usually come after a big platform shift.

171
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,906
We'll stick with the iPhone example here.

172
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:05,297
After mobile apps became a thing, many new companies got started that are now quite valuable.

173
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:12,448
And one of the reasons here is, you know, most large companies work on sort of an annual cadence at least.

174
00:15:12,428 --> 00:15:18,954
And when there's a huge platform shift, they are not good at making a big enough strategic pivot.

175
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:20,876
The battleship just turns too slowly.

176
00:15:21,497 --> 00:15:24,099
Whereas a startup can say, wow, woke up this morning.

177
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:26,862
The world is fundamentally different than it was six months ago.

178
00:15:26,882 --> 00:15:29,324
We're going to go all in on this new direction.

179
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:30,986
And so that's a way that startups usually win.

180
00:15:31,826 --> 00:15:33,988
Or that's an area where startups usually win.

181
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:35,710
There are many others.

182
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:41,035
But thinking about these three, I think, is directionally a good thing to do.

183
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:43,589
Alright, that's all I've got for today.

184
00:15:44,212 --> 00:15:46,182
Jeff, thank you very much for having me and for the class.
